= Restore Data to Couchbase Database

Backing up data for a Couchbase database is an essential part of a Disaster Recovery plan. This ensures that the data can be restored to the last backup in case of a disaster. This quick start guide will show how to backup data using Couchbase Community Edition. https://github.com/couchbase-guides/couchbase-backup[Another guide shows how to backup data] from a Couchbase server.

Couchbase Server has a command line tool called `cbbackupmgr`. Complete details about this tool is at https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/backup-restore/enterprise-backup-restore.html[cbbackupmgr].

For this guide, Couchbase Server is installed locally on a Windows machine. But similar instructions can be followed for other operating systems or cloud deployment.

I'm assuming you've already done the "backup" quick start guide, and you have a backup archive in a folder named `couchbasebackups`.

Remember that you can run cbbackupmgr's `list` command to get information about a backup archive folder.

[source,PowerShell]
----
PS C:\zproj> & 'C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbbackupmgr.exe' list --archive C:\zproj\couchbasebackups\
 Size      Items          Name
 567.91MB  -              /
 567.91MB  -              + cluster
 317.76MB  -                  + 2017-06-12T15_05_13.877654-04_00
 50.31MB   -                      + mybucket

Take note of the timestamp `2017-06-12T15_05_13.877654-04_00`.

== Restore Data to Couchbase Server

I've removed all the documents from all the buckets from my Couchbase cluster in preparation for the restore.

Note that the bucket must exist: the restore command will not create a bucket for you.

To restore all the buckets, run this command:

[source,PowerShell]
----
PS C:\myprojects> & 'C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbbackupmgr.exe' restore
    --archive C:\myprojects\couchbasebackups\
    --repo cluster
    --c http://localhost:8091
    --username Administrator
    --password password
    --start 2017-06-12T15_05_13.877654-04_00
    --end 2017-06-12T15_05_13.877654-04_00

Some notes about what you're doing here:

* `--archive` specifies the archive folder which was created for the backup
* `--repo` specifies the repo within the archive
* `--c`, `--username`, `--password` specify where to connect to the cluster, and the cluster credentials
* `--start` and `--end` specify the timestamp to start the restore from. I'm only going to restore from one backup, so start and end are the same.

== Summary

In this quick start guide, you went from a backup to restore. The cbbackupmgr tool has a lot of options to suit your needs, so make sure to check out the full documentation to see how it fits your organization's backup strategy. Also check out the link:https://github.com/couchbase-guides/couchbase-backup[Backup quick start guide]. And remember to test your backups and your backup process, so you can have confidence when something goes sideways.
